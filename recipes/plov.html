        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Plov is a centerpiece of Uzbek cuisine. Made of meat, oil, carrots and rice, it is considered staple food but there are numerous versions including luxury ones that are cooked only on special occasions.</p>
        <p>The three main steps are frying, boiling and steaming the ingredients as detailed below.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Oil or fat - 250 grams;</li>
            <li>Onion - 1 medium to large;</li>
            <li>Lamb or beef - 1 kg;</li>
            <li>Carrots - 1 kg;</li>
            <li>Rice - 1 kg.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the onions, cut carrots like you do for potato chips. Cut meat into bite sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Heat the empty pot, add oil/fat and heat till light smoke.</li>
            <li>Drop your onions and stir fry until golden brow. Then immediately add meat and fry until juices are gone and meat starts turning brown.</li>
            <li>Add carrots and fry 5 minutes or more until soft.</li>
            <li>Add some cumin seeds, salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Pour 0.8 litres of water, close the lid and bring to boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to simmer.</li>
            <li>Simmer covered for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Right after simmering started, put the rice in a large bowl, add tablespoon of salt, pour 2 litres of very warm water to soak in.</li>
            <li>Once rice soaked for 40+ minutes, gently rinse until water is clear.</li>
            <li>Put washed rice on top of the ingredients in the pot, don't mix, just flatten. Close the lid, raise heat to medium and wait 7-8 minutes until all the rice heats up and lots of steam come from under the lid.</li>
            <li>Open the lid, and carefully stir the rice layer, not touching under it. Note if any liquid remain under rice (it should still be boiling, not sizzling). If not, add 100 ml of boiling water.</li>
            <li>Add more cumin over the rice and close the lid for another 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Repeat the stirring of rice, by now there should be no water and the pot should be close to sizzling.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to minimum, close the lid and steam for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, carefully and gently mix all contents. Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
